inputs to MEX function

goal_planner(double* map, double* robot, double* machine, double* bin)
(X) map -> 0, 1
(X) list of machine locations (x, y, type, supply level)
(X) list of bin locations (x, y, type, supply level)

change Astar code so that it can read the obstacle map

copy A star code so that it can output cost instead of path

change code variables to be machine and bin --> (Changed it to machine and warehouse (can't name bin, bin is already name of node type))

output of planner (coords) coods for moving
output for actions space (x,y locations of actions) (warehouse and the bin)
(coordsx[warehouse bin]);


MATLAB Loop
call the planner
MATLAB animation
Matlab representation (after plan)

one step calc to change supply level 
(need to reduce supply levels for machine)
